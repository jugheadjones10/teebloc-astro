### How Drilling MCQs Can Boost Last-Minute PSLE Prep

It’s the final stretch before PSLE. With just a month to go, many students (and parents) feel the pressure. While it’s too late to start learning every single topic from scratch, one strategy often makes the difference: **focused MCQ practice.**

Why MCQs?

One of the most effective ways to remember what you revise is through _Active Recall_. Instead of rereading or highlighting, you test yourself by retrieving information from memory. This process strengthens long-term retention and keeps knowledge accessible for exams or everyday use.(find our blog post about it here: [https://teebloc.com/blog/active-recall](https://teebloc.com/blog/active-recall)) Drilling MCQs is one way you can use Active Recall in your revisions.

One of the best ways to retain what you study is through _Active Recall,_ which is to test yourself by retrieving information instead of just rereading or highlighting. This strengthens long-term memory and makes knowledge easier to access during exams (learn more in our blog post: [https://teebloc.com/blog/active-recall](https://teebloc.com/blog/active-recall)). Drilling MCQs is a practical way to apply Active Recall in your revision.

- **Broad coverage in short time:** MCQs test a wide range of topics quickly. Even 20 questions can expose gaps you might have missed.
- **Pattern recognition:** The PSLE often repeats question styles. Drilling MCQs trains students to spot common traps and phrasing.
- **Confidence booster:** Getting questions right builds momentum, and wrong answers highlight areas to revise fast.

How to use MCQs effectively in the last month:

1. **Time-box practice:** Do sets of 15–20 MCQs under timed conditions. This simulates exam pressure.
2. **Review mistakes immediately:** Don’t just check answers, but understand _why_ the wrong option was tempting.
3. **Target weak spots:** If a student consistently struggles in one topic (e.g., fractions in Math, grammar in English), focus MCQ drills there.

**Teebloc is HERE TO HELP!**

Instead of searching through stacks of past papers, tools like **Teebloc** let you generate topic-specific MCQ worksheets instantly. For example, if your child needs extra practice in “Percentage” or “Photosynthesis,” you can create a custom set in minutes. This saves precious revision time and keeps practice focused.

The key? **Consistency, not cramming.** Even 30 minutes a day of targeted MCQ drilling over the next month can sharpen exam readiness and reduce stress on the big day.

So, whether you’re a student doing self-revision, a parent guiding study sessions, or a tutor planning lessons, MCQs can be your best friend in the final lap before PSLE.
